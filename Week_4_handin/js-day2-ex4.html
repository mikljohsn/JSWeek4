    <select id="car-selector">
        <!-- Options will be populated by JavaScript -->
      </select>
      <h2>Selected Brand</h2>
      <p id="car-make"></p>
      <h3>Reflections</h3>
      <div style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 5px;padding: 1em;">
        I would use a select-element for options where there are a set number of options and not variable. For something like countries it can be used, even though
        it is a lot of options, i would still use it for such. But that would be the maximum number of options i would use a select for.
        In this exercise i created a loop over my cars array and made an arrow function that appended each car to my car selector as a new option. I then made an event listener
        where i took the value of the selected car and put it into a paragrah using the "change" keyword.

      <script>
      const cars = ["Ford", "WW", "Toyota", "Volvo"]; //Assume this was fechedfrom the backend
      
      cars.forEach(car => document.querySelector("#car-selector").appendChild(new Option(car))); //asked chatGPT for advice how to populate a select with JS
      
      const carMake = document.querySelector("#car-make");
      const carSelector = document.querySelector("#car-selector");
      carSelector.addEventListener("change", function(){
        carMake.textContent = carSelector.value;
      })
      </script>
